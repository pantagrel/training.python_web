#Flask Framework: Microblog
##Week 05

###I followed Flask's online tutorial. 

The things I'd like to add to the microblog:

1. The blog title dynamically links to a post view page.
	- This is working, but now I need to make the dynamic links browser-friendly (deal with spaces in post title, e.g.)
	- Adding previous and next links: increment and decrement id of post.
2. Add time and date stamps.
3. Run unittest.
4. Connect to a 'real' database. (Low priority/taks for week06)

###Stuff I need to learn more about:

1. Real expressions
2. unittest
3. The range of options available in CONFIG files.
	+ Do these options change across frameworks?
	+ How many should be set? 
	+ Is this like CSS where being explicit with as much as possible is a good thing?
4. Other frameworks
5. Putting the microblog on the bluebox server.
	+ The files are loaded there, but 
		Firefox can't establish a connection to the server 
		at block647048-4cf.blueboxgrid.com:5000.
	+ Something to do with [need to see notes], mentioned in week04
6. Passing the variables between functions, templates and user input. More practice.

###Stuff I don't understand:
1. Connecting to 'real' databases.
2. Talking to the database.
