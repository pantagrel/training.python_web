#Flask Framework: Microblog
##Week 05

###I followed Flask's online tutorial. 
The things I'd like to add to the microblog:
1. The blog title dynamically links to a post view page.
	a. This is working, but now I need to make the dynamic links browser-friendly (deal with spaces in post title, e.g.)
	b. 
2. Add time and date stamps.
3. Run unittest.
4. Connect to a 'real' database. (Low priority/taks for week06)

###Stuff I need to learn more about:
1. Real expressions
2. unittest
3. The range of options available in CONFIG files.
	a. Do these options change across frameworks?
	b. How many should be set? 
	c. Is this like CSS where being explicit with as much as possible is a good thing?
4. Other frameworks
5. Putting the microblog on the bluebox server.
	a. The files are loaded there, but 
		Firefox can't establish a connection to the server 
		at block647048-4cf.blueboxgrid.com:5000.
	b. Something to do with [need to see notes], mentioned in week04
6. Passing the variables between functions, templates and user input. More practice.

###Stuff I don't understand:
1. Connecting to 'real' databases.
2. Talking to the database.
