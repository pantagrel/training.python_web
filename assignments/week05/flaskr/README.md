#Flask Framework: Microblog
##Week 05

###I followed Flask's online tutorial. The things I'd like to add to the microblog:
1. The blog title dynamically links to a post view page.
2. Add time and date stamps.
3. Run unittest.
4. Connect to a 'real' database. (Low priority)

###Stuff I need to learn more about:
1. Real expressions
2. unittest
3. The range of options available in CONFIG files.
	-Do these options change across frameworks?
	-How many should be set? Is this like CSS where being explicit with as much as possible is a good thing?
4. Other frameworks
5. 

###Stuff I don't understand:
1. Adding and making dynamic links.
2. Connecting to 'real' databases.
