#Week 06

###Done:
- files moved into new (athome) directory
- djangor app installed
- database updated
- server still works

###To do:
- Build the required models to represent the blog data.
- Add a column for 'pub_date' to the entry model
- Allow each entry to be 'owned' by a User. Add a relation field to represent this.

  * *HINT* ``django.contrib.auth.models`` defines a ``User`` model.

- Build the urlconf required to present an entry list and a view for posting a
  new entry.  
- Add two new urls:
	* One should show the archive of all posts from a given month and year
  	* One should show all the posts by a single user
- Build views for each URL

# This will be turned in as fully as possible on Wednesday EOD.

##I'll be out of town with no internet service until then.
