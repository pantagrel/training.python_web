#The goals of the modest plant database project
___

1. Make a web app that works on the internet. [not happening by 12.00 3.15.2013]
2. With css and image files.
3. Different types of data can references other types of data. With links!

##Notions that seem cool but are just not possible given the timeframe:
1. Put the data into postgres.
2. Create a map view (like a grid with points) of different items.
3. Create user accounts.
4. Allow for uploading of images per data entry.
5. Create some kind of graphical interaction using maybe javascript. Like, click a color, get results.

That's it. Very modest. I just felt like I was in a raging torrent of information this whole quarter (which was great), but I wanted to actually slow down enough to tinker with the different moving parts enought to kinda internalize what is going on. With just one framework. And then, later, not this week, try that tinkering and internalizations with another framework. And after that, maybe refer back to wsgi and try to figure out what the hell it even *is*.
