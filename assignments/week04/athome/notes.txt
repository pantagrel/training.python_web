notes:
url initially will be localhost:8080
each book will be localhost:8080/book1

import bookdb.py to VM, run it = much harder
run it in wsgi-ref (easier, but with 8080 suffix)
mod-wsgi is harder (has to do with sys.path) but doesn't have suffix (will look for python modules to import, sys.path can help with this)
